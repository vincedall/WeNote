WeNote is an open source application to take notes.

You can easily export notes to the Notes folder in external storage of your phone.
You can import them only from the Notes directory as well.
This allows someone to backup their notes easily.

You can use the app as a file reader as it doesn't make a difference between
a .txt file or any other type of file. It means you can import any file you want and modify it.

The signed apk is available for download along with the code.
